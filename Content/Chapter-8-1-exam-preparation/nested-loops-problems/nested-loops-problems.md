# Nested Loops â€“ Problems

**The last** \(sixth\) problem of the "Programming Basics" Practical Exam requires using of **several nested loops and more complex logic inside them**. The problems examine participants' ability to **think in an algorithmic way** and to solve non-trivial coding problems that require nested loops with more complex logic and calculations, along with reading and printing data on the console.

Let's solve a few **sample problems** with nested loops and more complex logic:

* [Problem: Generating Rectangles](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/nested-loops-problems/nested-loops-problems/problem-generating-rectangles.md)
