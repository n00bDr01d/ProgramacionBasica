# The "Programming Basics" Practical Exam

The course **"Programming Basics"** at SoftUni finishes with a **practical exam**. There are **6** problems included, and you will have **4 hours** to solve them. **Each** of the exam problems will **cover** one of the **topics** studied during the course. Problem topics are as follows:

* Problem with **simple calculations** \(no conditions\)
* Problem with **simple condition** \(simple checks\)
* Problem with more **complex conditions** \(nested checks and multiple checks\)
* Problem with a **simple loop** \(e.g. iterate from 1 to N\)
* Problem with **nested loops** \(e.g. drawing a 2D figure on the console\)
* Problem with **nested loops** and **more complex logic** \(loops and checks together\)

## Video: The Practical Exam Explained

Watch this video to learn more about the practical exam, the problems, the evaluation and the automated judge system: [https://youtu.be/KPFk980HWhw](https://youtu.be/KPFk980HWhw).

## The Online Evaluation System \(Judge\)

**All exams and exercises** from this book are automatically **tested** through the online Judge system: [https://judge.softuni.org](https://judge.softuni.org). **For each** of the problems there are **visible** \(zero point\) tests to help you understand what is expected of the problem and fix your mistakes, as well as **competition** tests that are **hidden** and check if your solution is working properly. In the **Judge** system you can log in with your **softuni.org account**.

**How** does the testing in **Judge** work? **You upload** the source code and from the menu below you choose to compile as a **C\#** program. The program is being **tested** with a series of tests, giving **points** for each **successful** test.

## The Problems

Now, let's proceed with the **exam problems**. As it was already explained, they come in 6 groups, covering the 6 most important topics in this book:

* [Simple Calculations – Problems](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/simple-calculations-problems/simple-calc-problems.md)
* [Simple Conditions – Problems](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/simple-conditions-problems/simple-conditions-problems.md)
* [Complex Conditions – Problems](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/complex-conditions-problems/complex-conditions-problems.md)
* [Simple Loops – Problems](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/simple-loops-problems/simple-loops-problems.md)
* [Drawing Figures – Problems](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/drawing-figures-problems/drawing-figures-problems.md)
* [Nested Loops – Problems](/Content/Chapter-8-1-exam-preparation/nested-loops-problems/nested-loops-problems.md)
