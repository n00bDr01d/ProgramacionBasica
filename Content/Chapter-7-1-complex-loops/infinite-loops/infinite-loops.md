# Infinite Loops with Break

So far, we were introduced to various types of loops, learning what structures they have and how they are applied. Now, we need to understand what an **infinite loop** is, when it occurs, and how we can **break** it using the **`break`** operator.

Watch this video lesson to learn how to use infinite loops, along with the `break` operator: https://youtu.be/rpez6b9TpdA.

## Infinite Loop â€“ Explanation

We call an infinite loop one that **repeats infinitely** the performance of its body. In **`while`** and **`do-while`** loops the end check is a conditional expression that **always** returns **`true`**. Infinite **`for`** occurs when there is **no condition to end the loop**.

Here is what an **infinite `while`** loop looks like:

And here is what an **infinite `for`** loop looks like:

## The Operator "Break"

We already know that the infinite loop performs a certain code infinitely, but what if we want at some point under a given condition to go out of the loop? The **`break`** operator comes in handy in this situation.

<td>The <b><code>break</code></b> operator stops the execution of a loop at the time it is called and continues from the first line after the end of the loop. This means that the current iteration of the loop will not be completed, accordingly, the rest of the code in the body of the loop will not be executed.</td>
