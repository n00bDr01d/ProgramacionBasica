# Problem: Min Number

Write a program that inputs **n integers** (**n** > 0) and finds **the min** number among them (the smallest number). First enter the number of integers **n**, then **n** numbers additionally, one per line.

## Sample Input and Output

| Input                                | Output |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ |
| <p>2<br>100<br>99</p>                | 99     |
| <p>3<br>-10<br>20<br>-30</p>         | -30    |
| <p>4<br>45<br>-20<br>7<br>99<br></p> | -20    |
