# For Loops \(Repeating Code Blocks\)

In programming it is often required **to perform a block of commands multiple times**. In order to do that, the so-called **loops** are used. Let's examine an example of a `for`** loop** that passes sequentially through the numbers from 1 to 10 and prints them:

The loop starts with the `for`** operator** and passes through all values for a particular variable in a given range, for example the numbers from 1 to 10 \(included\), and for each value it performs a series of commands.

## Syntax: For-Loop

Upon declaring the loop, you can specify a **start value** and an **end value**. **The body of the loop** is usually enclosed in curly brackets `{ }` and represents a block of one or multiple commands. The figure below shows the structure of a `for`** loop**:

In most cases a `for`** loop** is run between `1` and `n` times \(for example from 1 to 10\). The purpose of the loop is to pass sequentially through the numbers 1, 2, 3, …, n and for each of them to perform a particular action. In the example above, the `i` variable accepts values from 1 to 10 and the current value is printed in the body of the loop. The loop repeats 10 times and each of these repetitions is called an "**iteration**".
