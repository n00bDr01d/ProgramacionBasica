# Example: Numbers from 1 to 100

Write a program that **prints the numbers from 1 to 100**. The program does not accept input and prints the numbers from 1 to 100 sequentially, each on a separate line.

## Video: Numbers 1...100

## Hints and Guidelines

We can solve the problem using a `for`** loop**, via which we will pass through the numbers from 1 to 100 using the `i` variable, and print the numbers in the body of the loop:
