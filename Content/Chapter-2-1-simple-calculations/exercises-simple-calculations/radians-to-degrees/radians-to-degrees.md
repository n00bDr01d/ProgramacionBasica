# Problem: Converter – from Radians to Degrees

Write a program, that reads **an angle in** [**radians**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian) (`rad`) and converts it to [**degrees**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28angle%29) (`deg`). Look for a proper formula on the Internet. The number **π** in C\# programs is available through `Math.PI`. Round the result to the nearest integer using the `Math.Round(…)` method.
