# Empty \(Blank\) Visual Studio Solution

We start by creating an empty solution **\(Blank Solution\)** in Visual Studio. The solutions in Visual Studio combine **a group of projects**. This opportunity is **very convenient**, when we want to **work on a few projects** and switch quickly between them or we want to **unite logically a few interconnected projects**.

In the current practical exercise, we will use a **Blank Solution with a couple of projects** to organize the solutions of the tasks from the exercises – every task in a separate project and all of them in a common solution.

* We start Visual Studio
* We create a new **Blank Solution:** \[**File**\] -&gt; \[**New**\] -&gt; \[**Project**\].

We choose from the **templates** -&gt; \[**Other Project Types**\] -&gt; \[**Visual Studio Solutions**\] -&gt; \[**Blank Solution**\] and we give an appropriate name of the project, for example “Simple-Calculations”:

Now we have created an **empty Visual Studio Solution** \(with 0 projects in it\):

The purpose of this blank solution is to add **a project per problem** from the exercises.
