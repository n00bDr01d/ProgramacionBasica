# Problem: Rectangle Area

A **rectangle** is defined by the **coordinates** of both of its opposite corners (x1, y1) – (x2, y2). Calculate its  **area and perimeter**. **The input** is read from the console. The numbers **x1, y1, x2 and y2** are given one per line. **The output** is printed on the console and it has to contain two lines, each with one number – the area and the perimeter.
