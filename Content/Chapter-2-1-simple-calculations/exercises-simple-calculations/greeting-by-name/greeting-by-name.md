# Problem: Greeting by Name

Write a program that **reads a person's name** and prints `Hello, <name>!`, where `<name>` is the name entered earlier.

## Hints and Guidelines

First, we create a **new C\# console project** with name “Greeting” in the solution “Simple-Calculations”:

Next, **we have to write the code** of the program. If you have any difficulties, you can use the code from the example below:

![](/assets/chapter-2-images/03.Greeting-by-name-02.png)

**Run** the program with \[**Ctrl+F5**\] and test if it works:
