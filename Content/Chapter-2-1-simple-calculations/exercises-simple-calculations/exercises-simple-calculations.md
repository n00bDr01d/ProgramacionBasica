# Exercises: Simple Calculations

Let's strengthen the knowledge gained throughout this chapter with a few **more exercises**.

## Video: Chapter Summary

Watch the following video to summarize what we learned in this chapter: [https://youtu.be/Zv\_c-M\_7Gyw](https://youtu.be/Zv_c-M_7Gyw).

## What We Learned in This Chapter?

Let's summarize what we learned in this chapter:

* **Reading a text**: `var str = Console.ReadLine();`
* **Reading an integer**: `var num = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());`
* **Reading a floating-point number**: `var num = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine());`
* **Calculations with numbers** and using the suitable  **arithmetic operators** \[+, -, \*, /, \(\)\]: `var sum = 5 + 3;`
* **Printing a text by placeholders** on the console: `Console.WriteLine("{0} + {1} = {2}", 3, 5, 3 + 5);`
