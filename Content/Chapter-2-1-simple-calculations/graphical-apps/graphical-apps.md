# Lab: GUI Apps with Numerical Expressions

To exercise working with variables and calculations with operators and numerical expressions, we will make something interesting: we will develop a **desktop application** with graphical user interface. In it, we will use calculations with floating point numbers. We will create two **GUI** (graphical user interface) applications:

* [GUI Application: Converter from BGN to EUR](bgn-to-eur-converter/bgn-to-eur-converter.md)
* [GUI Application: \* Catch the Button!](catch-the-button/catch-the-button.md)
