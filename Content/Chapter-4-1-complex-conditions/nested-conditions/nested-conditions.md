# Nested If-Else Conditions

Pretty often the program logic requires the use of `if` or `if-else` statements, which are contained one inside another. They are called **nested** `if` or `if-else` statements. As implied by the title **"nested"**, these are `if` or `if-else` statements that are placed inside other `if` or `else` statements.

```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    if (condition2)
    {
        // body; 
    }
    else
    {
        // body;
    }
}
```

## Deep Nesting

Nesting of **more than three conditional statements** inside each other is not considered a good practice and **has to be avoided**, mostly through optimization of the structure/the algorithm of the code and/or by using another type of conditional statement, which we are going to examine below in this chapter.

## Nested If-Else Conditions â€“ Examples

Let's take a few examples in order to gain experience about how to use **nested `if-else` conditions** in practice:
