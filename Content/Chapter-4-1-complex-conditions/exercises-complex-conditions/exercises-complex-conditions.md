# Exercises: More Complex Conditions

Now let's **exercise** our new skills with **complex conditions**. Let's solve a few practical tasks.

## Video: Chapter Summary

Watch this video to review what we learned in this chapter: [https://youtu.be/QOhyJXZ0HHQ](https://youtu.be/QOhyJXZ0HHQ).

## What We Learned in This Chapter?

Before proceeding ahead, let's remind ourselves about the new program constructs and techniques that we have learned in this chapter.

### Nested Conditions

```csharp
if (condition1)
{
    if (condition2)
        // body; 
    else
        // body;
}
```

### Complex Conditions with &&, \|\|, ! and \(\)

```csharp
if ((x == left || x == right) && y >= top && y <= bottom)
    Console.WriteLine(…);
```

### Switch-Case Conditions

```csharp
switch (selector)
{
    case value1:
        construction;
        break;
    case value2:
    case value3:
        construction;
        break;
    …
    default:
        construction;
        break;
}
```
