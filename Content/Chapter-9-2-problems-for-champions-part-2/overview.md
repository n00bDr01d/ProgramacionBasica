# Chapter 9.2. Problems for Champions â€“ Part II

In this chapter we will review three additional problems that belong to the category "**For Champions**", i.e. they are more complex than the rest of the problems in this book.

## More Complex Problems on the Studied Material

Before we move on to particular tasks, we must clarify that these can be solved in an easier way with **additional knowledge in programming with C\#** \(methods, arrays, collections, recursion, etc.\), but each solution that will be provided now only uses the material covered in this book. The goal is to learn how to construct **more complex algorithms** based on your knowledge collected up to the present moment.

## The Problems

The problems that we will solve in this chapter, are:

* [Problem: Passion Shopping Days](/Content/Chapter-9-2-problems-for-champions-part-2/passion-days/passion-days.md)
* [Problem: Numerical Expression](/Content/Chapter-9-2-problems-for-champions-part-2/expression/expression.md)
* [Problem: Bulls and Cows](/Content/Chapter-9-2-problems-for-champions-part-2/bulls-and-cows/bulls-and-cows.md)
