## Testing in the Judge System

Test your solution here: [https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/503\#3](https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/Practice/Index/503#3).

Try to **improve your solution**, so that it doesn't have many repeating commands. Could it be done with a `for` loop? Did you find a smart solution \(for example with a loop\) of the previous task? With this task you can also use something similar, but a bit more complex \(two loops, one inside the other\). If you don't succeed, there is no problem, we will be learning loops in a few chapters and you will be reminded of this task then.
