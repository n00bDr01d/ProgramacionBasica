# Problem: Expression

Write a console-based C\# console program that **calculates** and **prints** the value of the following numerical expression:

```
(3522 + 52353) * 23 - (2336 * 501 + 23432 - 6743) * 3
```

Note: **it is not allowed to previously calculate the value** \(for example with Windows Calculator\).

## Hints and Guidelines

Create **a new  C\# console project** with title "**Expression**". Find the method `static void Main(string[] args)` and **go into its body** between `{` and `}`. After that, **write the code** that calculates the above numerical expression and prints its value on the console. Put the above numerical expression inside the brackets of the command `Console.WriteLine(â€¦)`:
