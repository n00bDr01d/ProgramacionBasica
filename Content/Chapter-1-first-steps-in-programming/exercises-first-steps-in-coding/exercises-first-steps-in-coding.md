# Exercises: First Steps in Coding

Welcome to the **exercises**. Now we are going to write a couple of console applications, by which we are going to make a few more steps into programming. After that we will show how we can program something more complex – programs with graphical user interface.

## Video: Chapter Summary

Watch the following video to summarize what we learned in this chapter: https://youtu.be/GstN43-eN2g.

## What We Learned in This Chapter?

First, we have learned **what is programming** – **giving commands, written in a computer language**, which the machine understands and is able to execute. We understood what **a computer program** is – it represents a **sequence of commands**, arranged one after another. We got familiar with **the language for programming C\#** on a base level and how **to create simple console applications** with Visual Studio. We followed **the structure of the programming code in the C\# language**, as for example, the fact that commands are mainly given in the section `static void Main(string[] args)` between **the opening and closing curly parentheses**. We saw how to print with `Console.WriteLine(…)` and how to start our program with \[**Ctrl + F5**\]. We learned how to test our code in **SoftUni Judge**.

## The Exercises

Let's get started with the **exercises**. You didn't forget that programming is learned by writing a lot of code and solving problems, did you? Let's solve a few problems to confirm what we have learned.
