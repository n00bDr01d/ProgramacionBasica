# Problem: Calculate Rectangle Area

Write a C\# program that **reads** from the console **two numbers, a and b**, **calculates** and **prints** the area of a rectangle with sides **a** and **b**.

#### Sample Input and Output

| a | b | area |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2 | 7 | 14 |
| 7 | 8 | 56 |
| 12 | 5 | 60 |

## Hints and Guidelines

Create a new **console C\# program**. To **read both of numbers**, use the following commands:

What remains is to finish the program above, to calculate the area of the rectangle and to print it. Use the command that is already known to us `Console.WriteLine()` and put inside its brackets the multiplication of the numbers **a** and **b**. In programming, multiplication is done using the operator `*`.

## Test Your Solution

Test your solution with a few examples. You have to get an output, similar to this one \(we enter 2 and 7 as input and the program prints result 14 â€“ their multiplication\):

```
2
7
14
```
