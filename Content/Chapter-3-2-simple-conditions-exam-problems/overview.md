# Chapter 3.2. Simple Conditions – Exam Problems

In the previous chapter, we went through the simple conditional statements in C#, which we can use to execute different actions depending on a given condition. Now we shall solve a few **practical exercises** from SoftUni exams to gain some experience.

## Simple Conditions – Quick Review

We mentioned what **the scope** of a variable is, and how to track the execution of our program step by step \(the so-called **debugging**\) as well. In this chapter, we will practice working with simple conditions by going through some exam tasks. To do this, let's first revise their construction:

```csharp
if (bool expression)
{
    // condition body;
}
else
{
    // else-construction body;
}
```

`if`** conditions** consist of:

* `if`** clause**
* bool expression – a variable of bool type \(`bool`\) or bool logical expression \(an expression that results in `true/false`\)
* condition body – contains random block of source code
* `else`** clause** and its block of source code \(**optional**\)

## Exam Problems

After having revised how to write simple conditions, let' s solve a few **exam problems** in order to practice the `if-else` construction:
