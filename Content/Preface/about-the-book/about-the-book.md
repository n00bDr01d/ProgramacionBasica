## The History Behind This Book

The head of the project for the free programming books for beginners with open-source code is **[Dr. Svetlin Nakov](https://nakov.com)**. He is the main author and also the ideologist of the [**Software Developer programs’**](https://learn.softuni.org/catalog?utm_source=C+sharp&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=free+programming+books) learning content.

Everything started with the mass **free basic programming courses** that have been conducted in Bulgaria since 2014, when the "SoftUni" initiative was launched. At the beginning these courses had larger range and covered more theory, but in 2016 Dr. Svetlin Nakov completely revised, updated and simplified the whole method of teaching, strongly emphasizing on practice. This is how the core of the **learning content of this book was created**. It was completely natural to write a **book** for the tens of thousands of participants at the SoftUni basic programming course.

Following the principle of **free software and free knowledge**, Svetlin Nakov and a team of volunteers started this open-source project with the initial idea of writing a **free book** about the basics of programming with C#. Soon after, they created similar books for beginners with other programming languages (like Java, JavaScript, and Python).

The book was initially written in **Bulgarian** in 2017 and later translated into **English** in 2019.

The project is part of the hard work of the **[Software University Foundation](https://softuni.foundation)** to create and distribute an open learning content to teach software engineers and IT professionals.
