# Problem: Finding the Greater Number

Write a program that inputs **two integers** and prints the larger one.

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
|-----|------|
|5<br>3| 5 |
|3<br>5| 5 |
|10<br>10| 10 |
|-5<br>5| 5 |

## Hints and Guidelines

As usual, first we need to add a **new C# console project** to the existing solution. For the code of the program we need a single **`if-else`** statement. You can partially get assistance for the code from the picture that is deliberately blurred to make you think about how to write it yourself:

When we are done with the implementation of the solution, we **run** the program with [**Ctrl + F5**] and test it:
