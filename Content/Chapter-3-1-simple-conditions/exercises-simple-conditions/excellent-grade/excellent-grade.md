# Problem: Excellent Grade

The first exercise for this topic is to write a **console program** that **inputs the grade** (decimal number) and prints **Excellent!** if the grade is **5.50** or higher.

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
| --- | ---- |
| 6 | Excellent! |
| 5 | (no output) |
| 5.5 | Excellent! |
| 5.49 | (no output) |

## Creating a New C# Project

We create **a new project** in the existing Visual Studio solution. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on **Solution 'Simple-Conditions'**. Then choose [**Add**] -> [**New Project**]:
 
![](/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-01.png)

A dialog box will open for selecting a project. Choose **C# console application** and specify a name, for example "Excellent-Result":
 
![](/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-02.png)
 
Now we have a solution with one console application in it. What remains is to write the code to solve the problem.

## Writing the Program Code

For this purpose, we go into the body of the **`Main (string [] args)`** method and write the following code:

![](/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-03.png)

**Run** the program with [**Ctrl+F5**], to test it with different input values:

![](/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-04.png)

![](/assets/chapter-3-images/09.Excellent-result-05.png)

## Testing in the Judge System
