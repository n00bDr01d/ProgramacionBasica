# Problem: Even or Odd

Write a program that checks whether an **integer** is **even** or **odd**.

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
| --- | ---- |
| 2 | even |
| 3 | odd |
| 25 | odd |
| 1024 | even |

## Hints and Guidelines

Again, first we add **a new C# console project** in the existing solution. In the **`static void Main ()`** method, we have to write the program code. Checking if a given number is even can be done with the operator **`%`**, which will return the **remainder from an integer divided by 2** as follows: **`var isEven = (num % 2 == 0)`**.

Now we **run** the program with [**Ctrl + F5**] and test it:
