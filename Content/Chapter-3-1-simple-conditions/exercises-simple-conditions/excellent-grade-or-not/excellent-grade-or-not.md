# Problem: Excellent Grade or Not

The next exercise from this topic is to write a **console program** that **inputs the grade** (decimal number) and prints **Excellent!** if the grade is **5.50** or higher, otherwise "**Not excellent.**".

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
| --- | ---- |
| 6 | Excellent! |
| 5 | Not excellent. |
| 5.5 | Excellent! |
| 5.49 | Not excellent. |

## Creating a New C# Project and Writing the Program Code

First, we create **a new C# console project** in the **Simple-Conditions** solution.

  * We click on the solution in Solution Explorer and choose [**Add**] -> [**New Project**].
 
  * We choose [**Visual C#**] -> [**Windows**] -> [**Console Application**] and specify a name, for example: “Excellent-or-Not”.
 
Now we have to **write the code** of the program. You can get help by using the sample code from the picture:

## Automatic Switching to the Current Project

If try to run the program using **[Ctrl+F5]**, the result might be incorrect, because it might be the result from the previous project, not the current one, shown at the screen.

We turn on the mode for **automatic switching to the current project** by right-clicking on the main Solution and choosing [**Set StartUp Projects...**]:

A dialog box will appear, and you have to choose [**Startup Project**] -> [**Current selection**]:

## Local Testing

Now **we run the program** as usual with [**Ctrl + F5**] and test if it works correctly:
