# Problem: Guess the Password

Write a program that **inputs a password** (one line with random text) and checks if the input **matches** the phrase "**s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd**". If it matches, print "**Welcome**", otherwise "**Wrong password!**".

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
| --- | ---- |
| qwerty | Wrong password! |
| s3cr3t!P@ssw0rd | Welcome |
| s3cr3t!p@ss | Wrong password! |

## Hints and Guidelines

Use an **`if-else`** statement.
