# Problem: Areas of Figures

Write a program that **inputs the sizes of a geometric figure** and **calculates its area**. The figures are four types: **square**, **rectangle**, **circle** and **triangle**.

The first line of the input provides the type of the figure (`square`, `rectangle`, `circle`, `triangle`).
 * If the figure is a **square**, the next line provides one number – the length of its **side**.
 * If the figure is a **rectangle**, the next two lines we provide two numbers – the lengths of its **sides**.
 * If the figure is a **circle**, the next line provides one number – the **radius** of the circle.
 * If the figure is a **triangle**, the next two lines provide two numbers – the length of the **side** and the length of its **height**.

Round the result up to the **third digit after the decimal point**.

## Sample Input and Output
