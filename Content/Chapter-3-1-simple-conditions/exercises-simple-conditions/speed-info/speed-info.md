# Problem: Speed Assessment

Write a program that **inputs the speed** (decimal number) and prints **speed information**. For speed **up to 10** (inclusive), print "**slow**". For speed **over 10** and **up to 50**, print "**average**". For speed **over 50 and up to 150**, print "**fast**". For speed **over 150 and up to 1000**, print "**ultra fast**". For higher speed, print "**extremely fast**".

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output |
| --- | ---- |
| 8 | slow |
| 49.5 | average |
| 126 | fast |
| 160 | ultra fast |
| 3500 | extremely fast |
