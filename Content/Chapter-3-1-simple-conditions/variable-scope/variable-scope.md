# Variable Scope

Each variable has a range in which it exists, called **variable scope**. This range specifies where a variable can be used and how long is its **lifetime**. In the C\# language, the scope in which a variable exists, starts from the line in which we **defined it** and ends with the first closing curly bracket `}` \(of the method, the **if statement**, etc.\).

Thus, it is important to know that **any variable defined inside the body of certain `if` statement will not be available outside of it, **unless we have defined it higher in the code.

## Variable Scope â€“ Example

In the example below, on the last line we are trying to print the variable **salary** that is defined in the **if statement**, we will get an **error** because we don't have access to it.

The above code **will not compile**, because we are trying to access a variable **out of its scope**.
