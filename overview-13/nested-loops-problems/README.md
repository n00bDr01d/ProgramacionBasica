# Nested Loops â€“ Problems

**The last** (sixth) problem of the "Programming Basics" Practical Exam requires using of **several nested loops and more complex logic inside them**. The problems examine participants' ability to **think in an algorithmic way** and to solve non-trivial coding problems that require nested loops with more complex logic and calculations, along with reading and printing data on the console.

Let's solve a few **sample problems** with nested loops and more complex logic:

* [Problem: Increasing 4 Numbers](problem-increasing-4-numbers.md)
* [Problem: Generating Rectangles](problem-generating-rectangles.md)
