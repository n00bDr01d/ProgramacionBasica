# Drawing Figures â€“ Problems

**The fifth** problem of the "Programming Basics" Practical Exam requires using one or several **nested loops** for **drawing a figure** on the console. Participants in the exam should know how to **think logically** and construct simple algorithms using calculations, checks and nested loops to solve problems, i.e. to think in an algorithmic way. This problem is more about algorithmic thinking than about coding and loops.

Let's solve a few **sample problems** with nested loops (and drawing figures):

* [Problem: Perfect Diamond](problem-perfect-diamond.md)
* [Problem: Rectangle with Stars](problem-rectangle-with-stars.md)
