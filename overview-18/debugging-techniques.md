# Code Debugging Techniques

Debugging plays an important role in the process of creating software, which is to allow us to **follow the implementation** of our program **step by step**. With this technique we can **follow the values of the local variables**, because they are changing during the execution of the program, and to **remove** possible **errors** \(bugs\). The process of debugging includes:

* **Finding** the problems \(bugs\).
* **Locating** the code, which causes the problems.
* **Correcting** the code, which causes the problems, so that the program works correctly.
* **Testing** to make sure that the program works correctly after the corrections we have made.

## Debugging in Visual Studio

Visual Studio gives us **a built-in debugger**, thanks to which we can place **breakpoints** at places we have chosen. When it reaches a **breakpoint**, the program **stops running** and allows **step-by-step running** of the remaining lines. Debugging allows us to **get in the details of the program** and see where exactly the errors occur and what is the reason for this.

In order to demonstrate how to use the debugger in VS, we will use the following C# program:

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }
}
```

We will place a **breakpoint** at the function `Console.WriteLine(â€¦)`. For this we will need to move our cursor to the line, which prints on the console, and press [**F9**]. A **breakpoint** appears, showing where the program will **stop** running:

## Starting the Program in Debug Mode

In order to start  **the program in debug mode**, we choose \[**Debug**\] -&gt; \[**Start Debugging**\] or press \[**F5**\]:

After starting the program, we can see that it **stops executing** at line 11, where we placed our breakpoint. The code in the current line **is colored in yellow** and we can **run it step by step**. In order to go to **the next line**, we use the key \[**F10**\]. We can see that **the code on the current line hasn't executed yet** and it is displayed in yellow. It will execute when we go ahead with the debugging the next line.

The screenshot below shows **the Visual Studio debugger**, stopped at the breakpoint and waiting for the developer to decide what to do (e.g. execute the next command or stop the program):

From the **Locals** window we can observe **the changes in the local variables** or **modify their values at runtime**. In order to open the window, you must choose \[**Debug**\] -&gt; \[**Windows**\] -&gt; \[**Locals**\].
