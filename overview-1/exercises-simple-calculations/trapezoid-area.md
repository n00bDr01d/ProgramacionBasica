# Problem: Trapezoid Area

Write a program that reads three numbers from the console **b1, b2 and h and calculates the area of a trapezoid** with bases **b1 and b2 and height h. The formula for trapezoid area is \(b1 + b2\) \* h / 2**.

The figure below shows a trapezoid with bases 8 and 13 and height 7. It has an area **\(8 + 13\) \* 7 / 2 = 73.5**.

## Hints and Guidelines

Again, we have to add to the existing Visual Studio solution another **console C\# project** with name "Trapezoid-Area" and write the **code that reads the input from the console, calculates the trapezoid area and prints it**:

The code in the picture is purposely blurred, in order for you to give it a thought and finish it yourself.

**Test** your solution locally using \[**Ctrl+F5**\] and enter an exemplary data.
