# Problem: Concatenating Text and Numbers

Write a C\# program, that reads a first name, last name, age and city from the console and prints a message of the following kind: `You are <firstName> <lastName>, a <age>-years old person from <town>`.

## Hints and Guidelines

We add to the existing Visual Studio solution one more console C\# project with name “Concatenate-Data”. We **write the code** which reads the input from the console:

![](/assets/chapter-2-images/04.Concatenate-data-01.png)

**The code** that prints the message described in the problem requirements should be finished.

![](/assets/chapter-2-images/04.Concatenate-data-02.png)

In the picture above the code is blurred on purpose, in order for you to think of a way to finish it yourself.

Next, the solution should be tested locally using \[**Ctrl+F5**\] and by entering an exemplary input data.
