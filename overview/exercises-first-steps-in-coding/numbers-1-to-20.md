## Hints and Guidelines

Create **a C\# console application** with name “`Nums1To20`”:

![](/assets/chapter-1-images/03.Numbers-1-to-20-01.png)

Inside the `static void Main()` method write 20 commands `Console.WriteLine(…)`, each on a separate line, in order to print the numbers from 1 to 20 one after another. Some of you may be wondering if there is a smarter way. Relax, there is, but we will mention it later on.![](/assets/chapter-1-images/03.Numbers-1-to-20-02.png)Now **we start the program** and we check if the result is what it is supposed to be:

```
1
2
…
20
```

Now think whether we can write the program **a smarter way**, so we don't repeat the same command 20 times. Seek out information on the Internet about "[**for loop C\#**](https://www.google.com/search?q=for+loop+C%23&oq=for+loop+C%23)".
