# 7.2. More Complex Loops – Exam Problems

In the previous chapter we learned **how to execute** a block of commands **more than once** using a **for** loop. To improve our knowledge, let's solve some **more complicated problems with loops**, given at the exams in SoftUni.

## More Complex Loops – Quick Review

In the previous chapter **we reviewed some loop structures** that would help us solve more complex problems:

* **loops with a step** (e.g. print the numbers 1, 3, 5, …, n)
* **nested** loops (loops located inside other loops)
* `while` loops (repeat a block of code while an entrance condition is true)
* `do-while` loop (repeat a block of code while an exit condition is true)
* **infinite** loops and breaking out of loop (`break` operator)
* `try-catch` construction (handle runtime errors)

## Exam Problems

Let's start work on solving the following practical exam problems:

* [Problem: Dumb Passwords Generator](stupid-password-generator.md)
* [Problem: Magic Numbers](magic-combination.md)
* [Problem: Stop Number](stop-number.md)
* [Problem: Special Numbers](special-numbers.md)
* [Problem: Digits](digits.md)
