# Problem: Min Method (Return the Smaller Number)

Create a method **`GetMin(int a, int b)`**, which returns the smaller of two numbers. Write a program, which takes as input three numbers and prints the smallest of them. Use the method **`GetMin(â€¦)`**, which you have already created.

## Sample Input and Output

| Input | Output | Input | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|1<br>2<br>3|1|-100<br>-101<br>-102|-102|

## Hints and Guidelines

Define a method **`GetMin(int a, int b)`** and implement it, after which invoke it from the main program as shown below. In order to find the minimum of three numbers, first find the minimum of the first two and then the minimum of the result and the third number:

```csharp
var min = GetMin(GetMin(num1, num2), num3);
```
