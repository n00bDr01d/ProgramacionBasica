# 9.1. Problems for Champions â€“ Part I

In this chapter, we will offer the reader a few **more difficult tasks** that aim to develop **algorithmic skills** and acquire **programming techniques** to solve tasks with higher complexity.

## More Complex Problems on the Studied Material

We will solve together several programming problems that cover the material studied in the book, but more difficult than the usual problems of the entrance exams at SoftUni. If you want to become a **champion on the basics of programming**, we recommend training to solve such complex tasks to make it easy for you to take exams.

## The Problems

The problems that we will solve in this chapter, are:

* [Problem: Crossing Sequences](crossing-sequences.md)
* [Problem: Magic Dates](magic-dates.md)
* [Problem: Five Special Letters](five-special-letters.md)
