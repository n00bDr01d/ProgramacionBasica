# If-Else Conditions â€“ Examples

Now let's take a few examples \(exercises\) to learn how to use `if-else` conditional statements in practice.

## Video: Examples of If-Else

Watch the video lesson about the "Even or Odd Number" and "The Larger Number" problems and their solutions: [https://youtu.be/qIUoKiObr-A](https://youtu.be/qIUoKiObr-A).

## Example: Even or Odd Number

Write a program that checks whether an integer is **even** or **odd**.

### Hint and Guidelines

We can solve the problem with one `if-else` statement and the operator `%`, which returns a **remainder by dividing** two numbers.

## Example: The Larger Number

Write a program that reads from the console **two integers** and prints **the larger** of them. Print "**Greater number: **" + **the bigger number**.

The **input** comes as two numbers, each on a separate line. Sample input:

```
3
5
```

The **output** is a message like the shown below. Sample output:

```
Greater number: 5
```

### Hint and Guidelines

Our first task is to **read** the two numbers from the console. Then, with a simple `if-else` statement, combined with the **operator for greater than** \(`>`\), we do check. Part of the code is deliberately blurred, so you can test what you learned so far.
