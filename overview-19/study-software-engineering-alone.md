# Study Software Engineering in Your Own Way

Another possibility to develop after this book is to **continue studying programming outside of SoftUni**. You can enroll or subscribe to **video trainings** that go into more details in programming with C# or other languages and development platforms. You can **read books** on programming and software technologies, follow **online tutorials** and other online resources â€“ there are plenty of free materials on the Internet. However, keep in mind that the most important thing towards the profession of a programmer is **to do practical projects**!

**You cannot become a programmer without a lot of code writing and intense practicing**. Allocate **sufficient time** to it. You cannot become a programmer for a month or two. On the Internet you will find a wide variety of **free resources**, such as books, manuals, video lessons, online and on-site courses on programming and software development. However, you need to invest **at least a year or two** to acquire a foundation level, needed for starting a job.

After you gain some experience, find a way to start **an internship in a company** (which will be almost impossible unless you'd spent at least a year of intense code writing before that) or come up with **your own practical project**, on which you need to spend a few months, even a year, in order to learn based on the trial-and-error principle.
