# Problem: Fibonacci Numbers

Fibonacci's numbers in mathematics form a sequence that looks like this:  **1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, â€¦**.

**The formula** to form the Fibonacci sequence is:

```csharp
F0 = 1
F1 = 1
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
```

#### Sample Input and Output

| Input \(n\) | Output | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 89 | F\(11\) = F\(9\) + F\(8\) |
| 5 | 8 | F\(5\) = F\(4\) + F\(3\) |
| 20 | 10946 | F\(20\) = F\(19\) + F\(18\) |
| 0 | 1 | By definition |
| 1 | 1 | By definition |

Enter **an integer** number **n** and calculate the **n-number of Fibonacci**.

## Hints and Guidelines

An idea to solve the problem:

* We create **a variable** `n` to which we assign an integer value from the console input.
* We create the variables `f0` and `f1` to which we assign a value of **1**, since the sequence starts.
* We create a `for` loop with condition **the current value** `i < n - 1`.
* In **the body of the loop**:
  * We create **a temporary** variable `fNext`, to which we assign the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.
  * To `f0` we assign the current value of `f1`.
  * To `f1` we assign the value of the temporary variable `fNext`.
* Out of the loop we print the n-th number of Fibonacci.
