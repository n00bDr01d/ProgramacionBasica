# Example: Even Powers of 2

Print **the even** powers of **2** to **2^n**: **2^0, 2^2, 2^4, 2^8, â€¦, 2^n**. For example, if **n = 10**, the result will be: **1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024**.

## Hints and Guidelines

Here is how we can solve the problem using a **for-loop with a step**:

* We create a `num` variable for the current number to which we assign an initial **value of 1**.
* For **a step** of the loop, we set a value of **2**.
* In **the body of the loop**: we print the value of the current number and **increase the current number **`num`** 4 times** \(according to the problem's description\).
