# Example: Summing Up Digits

Let's practice the `do-while` loop with the following exercise:

Sum up the digits of a **positive** integer **n**. Examples:
 - If **n = 5634**, the result will be: 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 = **18**.
 - If **n = 920**, the result will be: 9 + 2 + 0 = **11**.

## Hints and Guidelines

We can use the following **idea to solve the problem**: extract many times the last digit from the input number and sum the extracted digits until the input number reaches 0. Example:
  - sum = 0
  - n = 563**4** ðŸ¡’ extract 4; sum += 4; n = 563
  - n = 56**3** ðŸ¡’ extract 3; sum += 3; n = 56
  - n = 5**6** ðŸ¡’ extract 6; sum += 6; n = 5
  - n = **5** ðŸ¡’ extract 5; sum += 5; n = 0 ðŸ¡’ end

In more detail the above idea looks like this:

   * We create the variable **`n`**, to which we assign a value equal to the number entered by the user.
   * We create a second variable â€“ **`sum`**, which initial value is 0. We will use it for the calculation and storage of the result.
   * As a loop condition, we will use **`n > 0`** because after each calculation of the result in the body of the loop, we will remove the last digit of **`n`**.
   * In the body of the loop:
       * We assign a new value of **`sum`** that is the result of the sum of the current value of **`sum`** with the last digit of **`n`**.
       * We assign a new value to **`n`**, which is the result of removing the last digit of **`n`**.
   * Outside the body of the loop, we print the final value of the sum.
   
This is a sample code, implementing the above described steps:

<table><tr><td><img src="/assets/alert-icon.png" style="max-width:50px;" /></td>
<td><code><strong>n % 10</strong></code>: <b>returns</b> the last digit of the number <code><strong>n</strong></code>.<br>
<code><strong>n / 10</strong></code>: <b>deletes</b> the last digit of <code><strong>n</strong></code>.</td>
</tr></table>
